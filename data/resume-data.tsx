I built Koinu, an npm library that allows developers to include a cross chain experience within their dapps.  This project was selected as a finalist project, along with 9 other finalist projects, out of 500 projects.  Being the only under-18 to win the competition, and competiting against the best and most hardcore developers in the Web3 space, out of 515 projects, I learnt a lot more about Web3 and blockchain development during the course of the hackathon and it encouraged me to build blockchain applications more : the fact that I could compete, as a 15 year old, at the time, against the top developers of the Web3 space, and win, I am looking forward to build more applications for everyday users of Web3",

The entire hackathon was an amazing learning process to me, especially for learning more about blockchain development - throughout the entire hackathon, I had many chances to talk face to face with top leaders and developers in the Web3 space - all these people, all the other teams, together in one big room in the town of Waterloo, building and sharing a passion together.  An even bigger impact personally was being able to travel all the way from where I live, Hong Kong, all the way to Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, and hack along with two University of Waterloo students, herby gaining exposure to university life and working as a development team.
